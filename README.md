# NYC4Free
Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree Program Capstone Project, available on Google Play as NYC4Free Guide.

The NYC4Free app provides visitors and locals alike with a year-round, curated guide to New York City cultural events and attractions that are free or pay-what-you-wish, including concerts, films, performances, museums, exhibits and talks.  

Easily view events that are free by date, or attractions that are always free.  Save favorites, share events, add them to your calendar and link to event websites.  NYC4Free puts what’s happening and when at your fingertips!   

The intended users are the 60+ million travelers who visit NYC annually and NYC residents who want to take advantage of all the city has to offer.  

APP FEATURES:

- Displays information about free NYC events and attractions (“Events”).  The user can view: 

    “Free today” Events: A chronological guide to Events that are free on specific days.  For example, the Museum of Modern Art is free on Fridays from 4-8 pm. 
    
    “Always free” Events: A separate guide to Events that are always free, such as the Museum at FIT.  Note that there is no content overlap between these Events and those listed in chronological order above.  The “always free” Events are listed separately to avoid the repetition of listing them every day in the chronological listing. 

- Saves information: the user can favorite any Event and can view their favorites both within the app and, at a high level, in the app’s widget.  
- Shares information: the user can share any Event via social media.
- Updates the user’s calendar: the app uses intents supported by the Calendar application to allow the user to add Events to their calendar.
- Links the user directly to the website for each Event, for access to the most detailed information available from the Event provider.
